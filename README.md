## 📌 Problem Statement – *Rethinking Trade Lifecycle Management*

Legacy post-trade systems are siloed, rigid, and lack real-time visibility. This leads to:

- ❌ Delayed and fragmented exception tracking  
- ❌ Static, non-personalized trade reports  
- ❌ Manually operated agent logic without orchestration  
- ❌ No interactive or intuitive analyst interface  

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a **modular**, **cloud-native**, and **agentic AI-powered** orchestration system to:
- 📊 Provide **real-time exception tracking**
- 💬 Enable **chat-based insights** for operations analysts
- ⚙️ Automate post-trade functions with **goal-driven agents**
- ☁️ Use **event-driven AWS services** for seamless scalability
